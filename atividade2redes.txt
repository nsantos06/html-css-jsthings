Dropbox
To answer you further, it uses TCP for some things (sending and receiving files from the dropbox servers for instance). It also uses UDP, to discover other computers on your network that may have the files you need for syncing.

All video streaming protocols are based on transport protocols. The most frequently used are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). ... However, due to the fact that TCP is widely used for various activities on the web, UDP transport protocol might be blocked by some firewalls.Aug 26, 2016

Reddit
Reddit uses HTTP, which is normally built on top of TCP/IP, not UDP. In addition, UDP is commonly used in streaming media. It can be used anywhere that data loss will not be fata

There are some use cases where losing data is better than waiting for data to be resent. Real-time voice communication, for instance. When you drop a few packets with UDP, you get a bit of static.
But if you were to lose TCP packets, the entire voice stream stops completely until the missing packets could be re-sent, and then continues on. Which means that you're now listening to what the person said a fraction of a second ago, so now you either have to deal with ever-increasing lag time as missing packets push the conversation more and more out of sync, or you have to slice out a bit of the conversation completely so that you can catch up to being in real-time again.

TCP deals with congestion and bandwidth allocation automatically. Decades of algorithms work in your favor if you use TCP.
A single missing packet will seriously mess up your video stream. Remember that long sequences of movie pictures are sent as a single whole image plus delta instructions to generate the rest of the images. A single bad packet can screw up a second of video.

TCP is more efficient than UDP if you don't need low-latency delivery, because you can compress more data at once and waiting for retransmitted packets isn't a problem. This also ensures you get a high quality stream through the viewing experience unless there are major congestion problems.
A video chat will always prefer UDP transmission for the lowest latency possible, but quality may vary and bandwidth usage can technically be higher.
