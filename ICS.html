        What Is Computer Science?
        <p>
            Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. 
            <br>It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. 
            <br>A computer scientist studies the theory of computation and the design of software systems.
        </p>
        What Is Algorithms?
        <p>     
            In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions.
            <br>Typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
            <br>Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
